# c-data-structures
This repository features a plethora of different data structures that are commonly used in programming. These implementations have been written in C as C does not have built-in implementations of these structures, meaning that they would need to be built from scratch. This repo includes implementations for the following:
1. Linked List
2. Stack
3. Tree Set

There are tests included for each of these to demonstrate that they work without memory leaks, segfaults, etc. There are also come complexity test; however, these are still a WIP.
